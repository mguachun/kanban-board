# Kanban Board using React + TypeScript + Vite

A Kanban board that allows a user to record their progress on a board for transparency and optimal project management.

This app was used with React.js Vite. The JS library, react-beautiful-dnd was used to add drag and drop functionality to the kanban board. Styled allows developers to write actual CSS code to style React and React Native components using JavaScript tagged template literals. An open source api: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ was also used to populate the kanban board to simulate tasks and multiple users on the board. Please be aware that this is a first protoype project. The draggable actions can lag in performance if used constantly.


To run application:
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you have the proper dependencies including ant, antd, react-beautiful-dnd, react dom, and styled components. 
- Run local host by running `npm run dev` to run and interact with the app
